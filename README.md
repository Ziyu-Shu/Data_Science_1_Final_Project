# From Words to Actions: U.S. and China Political Incident Forecasting Through U.S. Official Statement Analysis

**Authors:** Alisha Bi, Ziyu Shu  
**Date:** December 2025  

## Abstract
Great Power Competition and global shifts toward populism have changed the tone and intent of official diplomatic rhetoric. Furthermore, post-Cold War general stability in U.S. foreign relations is declining, in part motivated by dynamicism in the U.S.???China relationship. In this study, we explore to what extent official U.S. diplomatic statements about the People's Republic of China predict or bring about subsequent bilateral events. Focusing on bilateral events data and official White House statements from 2009 to 2025, we applied lexicon-based sentiment analysis to statements and examined their relationship with U.S???China events using time-series methods. Our diagnostic tests indicated no statistically significant predictive or Granger causal relationships. Limitations highlighted by these results are textual and event feature richness, and the inherent difficulty of establishing causality in international relations. Further research or analysis might address these limitations by mitigating potentially confounding data through filtering events and statements by relevance and significance, though this would require investigation of significance metrics and whether White House statements are the most relevant to diplomatic relations in the era of social media.
